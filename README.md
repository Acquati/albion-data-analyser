# Albion Data Analyser

[Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/home) has 7 cities, each one having an exclusive market, the players that have to bring items from one market to another, the players can make sell orders and buy orders or directly sell and buy items.

When a player earns loot in the game, the market called "Black Market" is what gives the items, controlled by the game itself, makes a buy order and players in the city called "Caerleon" can fulfill it, it often makes a buy order higher than the regular markets.

This application aims to find the best items to sell to the "Black Market" with a higher profit or other parameters.

This project is possible by the [Albion Online Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/), it collects and distributes real-time information for Albion Online. This is achieved with a downloadable client that monitors network traffic specifically for Albion Online, identifies the relevant information, and then ships it off to a central server which distributes the information to anyone who wants it.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
